# Checking bxdecay0

In this section we take a look at the primary spectrum produced by the
_bxdecay0_ package. The main documentation for this extension is available
[here](https://github.com/BxCppDev/bxdecay0). It aims to reproduce reasonable
primary particles to be used as generator for double beta decay physics.

## Primary electron properties

The main thing we can compare here are the properties of the primary electrons
produced. The _bxdecay0_ package actually does not even produce the neutrinos
emitted in e.g. `2vbb`.
