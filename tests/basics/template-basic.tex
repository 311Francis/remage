    \caption{Geant4 visualisation of a simulation of $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay in a HPGe detector (left) and $^{60}$Co in a source above the detector (right( for a typical screeing \
    setup. For the left figure you should see the trajectories focused around the HPGe detector and mainly electrons (red), with a \
    few gamma (green) being produced. For the right you should see $\gamma$ particles (in green) throughout  the experimental setup starting from a source above the detector
